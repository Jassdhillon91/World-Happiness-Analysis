Which countries are happier and which social and economic reasons lead to the people of a country being happy
# Data Collection
The happiness scores and rankings are calculated using data from the Gallup World Poll. These scores are determined based on responses to the main life evaluation question in the poll, known as the Cantril ladder. Respondents are asked to envision a ladder where 10 represents the best possible life and 0 represents the worst possible life, and then rate their current lives on this scale. The scores are derived from nationally representative samples spanning from 2015 to 2019, and Gallup weights are applied to ensure the estimates are representative. The subsequent columns following the happiness score indicate the degree to which six factors - economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, perception of corruption, and generosity - contribute to higher life evaluations in each country compared to Dystopia, a hypothetical nation with values equivalent to the world's lowest national averages for each of these factors. While these factors do not affect the total score reported for each country, they do shed light on why certain countries are ranked higher than others.
